## saJSON ##

webMethods package that can transform any webMethods Document into a JSON String and vice versa

Has two main methods : 

- saJSON.services:toJSON
- saJSON.services:fromJSON

There is also another auxiliar method to translate a JSON into an XML called saJSON.services:jsonToXML

Uses the [JSON-Java](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-java) library


You can either download and install the saJSON.zip webMethods package.
Or download all the files and zip them together, however several webMethods created folders have been delete by Github because they were empty.

This package has been tested in webMethods version 7.* and 8.*
